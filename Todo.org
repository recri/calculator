[ ] implement basic google "calculator"
[x] modified ganja.js to import {Algebra} from './ganja.js'
[ ] use ganja.js to implement clifford algebras
[x] make an appropriate icon
[x] make basic google calculator keypad layout.
[x] add drop shadows to basic layout
[x] enable key input and test Inv key operation
[ ] several clevernesses in the model calculator
	e^x, x^y, pow(x, 1/y),
	1 - grabs existing x from the accumulator
	and stuffs it into place in the expression
	2 - sets y to be a <sup></sup> entry field
	in the accumulator.
[x] implemented a simple history stack 
[x] implemented a simple input parser
[ ] add more error checking to input parser
[ ] construct AST while parsing,
	with ranges of input text identified
	and manage it on the history stack, too.
[ ] text === '0' is the wrong test, history.length === 0
	is true when the zero in the accumulator is just
	something the calculator left there.  If you want
	an expression that begins with 0, key a 0, and it
	will be treated as an operand.
[x] make focus on load to enable immediate key input.
[ ] fix the location of the focus border on the text box.
[x] make the Inv button change background color when selected
[ ] make the toggle cover that moves for the Rad Deg buttons.
