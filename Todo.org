[x] implement basic google "calculator"
[x] modified ganja.js to import {Algebra} from './ganja.js'
[ ] use ganja.js to implement clifford algebras
	only does +,-,*,/,basis vectors and various other
	products, so keep the cnumber(), and probably import it
	into cnumber
[x] make an appropriate icon
[x] make basic google calculator keypad layout.
[x] add drop shadows to basic layout
[x] enable key input and test Inv key operation
[ ] several clevernesses in the model calculator
	e^x, x^y, pow(x, 1/y),
	1 - grabs existing x from the accumulator
	and stuffs it into place in the expression
	2 - sets y to be a <sup></sup> entry field
	in the accumulator.
[x] implemented a simple history stack 
[x] implemented a simple input parser
[x] add more error checking to input parser
[x] construct AST while parsing,
	with ranges of input text identified
	and manage it on the history stack, too.
[x] text === '0' is the wrong test, history.length === 0
	is true when the zero in the accumulator is just
	something the calculator left there.  If you want
	an expression that begins with 0, key a 0, and it
	will be treated as an operand.
[x] make focus on load to enable immediate key input.
[x] fix the location of the focus border on the text box.
	it's a bonus styling, onFocus augments classes,
	classes of objects that enclose the focusee, and
	those enclosing objects create the shadow box.
[x] make the Inv button change background color when selected
[x] make the toggle cover that moves for the Rad Deg buttons.
	Just faded the deselected label.
[x] make '^C' not trigger cos()
[x] make ' ' fire selected button
[x] make all focus targets key sensitive
[ ] rewrite with web-components to encapsulate the div soup
[ ] calculator-button,
[ ] calculator-accumulator,
[ ] calculator-history
[ ] calculator-menu
[ ] figure out firefox's problem with nested <span>'s in txt
[ ] implement a material design color palette by role name
	as css vars and use them to configure the colors in
	the calculator.
[ ] make the icon beefier, too thin
[x] make 'D' a hotkey for 'Deg' which then toggles the Rad Deg
	selector.
[x] fix %
[x] fix pi
[x] fix e
[ ] can I fix the div soup and keep focus traversal?
[x] auto close future parens on =
[ ] replace NaN result with error, figure out errors better
[ ] replace toFixed(7) with a more adaptive format
[ ] options, set the number of fixed places kept
[ ] work out flex layout details
	going from wide to narrow
[x] drawer menu draws under calculator, z-index issue, not sure
	what requires z in the calculator layout
[ ] drawer menu does not return to calculator
[ ] eliminate title
[ ] move hamburger menu onto calculator frame
	meaning all the other pages need a calculator frame, too?
[ ] Interesting how the functions move toward reverse polish even
	when you're presenting an algebraic formula, the grabLHS
	operators are sort of half reverse polish, and there are
	others which would be useful in reverse polish forms, such
	as sqrt('of the expression I just entered') rather than
	evaluate the expression followed by sqrt(Ans).
[ ] google only inserts an x if necessary, 2pi shows with no space.
